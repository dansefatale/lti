lti is a handy ruby script that let's you convert
a string of latex code directly to a png image on
the commandline. It is meant to quickly make images
of formulas which can then be included in e.g. 
webpages or textdocuments.
lti depends on the following programs being present
on your computer (and in your path):
	- latex (of course)
	- ghostscript
	- dvips
	- ImageMagick (it uses the convert command)

Currently lti is only tested on OS X Tiger but it
should run also on linux. Windows will follow.
